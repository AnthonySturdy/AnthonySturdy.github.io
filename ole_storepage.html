                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>This website is a storepage for a pretend game development company. It was made for my Computing Professional and Business Skills module at Staffordshire University (Year 1, Semester 2). For our assignment, we were tasked with creating a storepage for a company called "OLE Ltd." to sell their game and DLC's.</p>
                <p>The website was created in a group of three, my role was mostly frontend, I did most of the HTML, CSS and Javascript, I helped out with the backend (PHP, SQL) occasionally, and had to be familiar with how it all worked. <a href="https://davidtaylor6130.github.io/">David Taylor</a> did most of the backend work, and lastly, Conor McCann did most of the documentation.</p>
                <h2>Features</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Individual Product Pages</li>
                    <li>Account Creation</li>
                    <li>Edit Account Details</li>
                    <li>Consistent Styling</li>
                    <li>Basket System</li>
                    <li>Password Hashing</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>What I learned</h2>
                <p>This assignment taught me a lot about creating websites, I knew nothing about using CSS or Javascript before making it and it's been very useful, especially for making this portfolio. I learned to keep the HTML and CSS organised to avoid it become difficult to change later on, and how important communication is within a team.</p>
