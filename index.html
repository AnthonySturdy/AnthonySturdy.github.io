                <h2><span>></span> about</h2>

                <p>Hello! My name is Anthony. I'm currently a student at <a href="https://www.staffs.ac.uk/">Staffordshire University</a> studying my final year of BSc Computer Games Programming. I recently completed the placement year of my course, which was spent as an intern at <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity Technologies</a>, as a Sustained Engineer.</p>
                <p>My coursework primarly involves using C++ to create games and game engines with DirectX, OpenGL and SDL. Other modules have covered using C# for multithreaded/task-based applications and networked applications. I have a keen interest in Graphics and Engine programming, and enjoy focussing on them throughout my coursework.</p>
                <p>At <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a>, I worked on a variety of different projects and tasks. However, the majority of my time was spent fixing engine bugs (C++), writing automated editor tests (C#) and improving various <a href="https://scan.coverity.com/">Coverity Static Analysis</a> internal tooling by creating a <a href="https://datastudio.google.com/overview">Google Data Studio</a> dashboard (Python, BigQuery) and implementing support for modelled functions, in order to reduce false positives (C++, C#).</p>
                <p>Outside of my work, I also enjoy cooking, exercising, listening to music, and playing video games.</p>

                        <p>I implemented mechanics related to the voxel terrain, a full list of features I implemented can be seen in the expanded information. The voxel terrain system was originally prototyped in Unity while other team members set up DirectX11 boilerplate and camera controls, which allowed me to get the systems working before then porting from C# to C++ in the DirectX application.</p>

                    <h2>What I learned</h2>
                    <p>Working with 5 other people taught me a lot about working in a team and how important project management is. This was the biggest team I had worked with, and without constant communication, team meetings and updating our Trello board, we wouldn't have made nearly as much progress. We did encounter a few problems where people were waiting for other features to be finished before they could finish their own features, so in the future I think planning ahead and knowing which features to complete first in order to counter that would be useful.</p>
                    <p>With a larger team relying on my code, it also forced me to think about and plan the structure and readability of the code, which I hadn't necessarily had to do before. This lead to me writing much more cleaner and extensible code than I previously have in solo projects.</p>

This was my first experience using a programmable pipeline to render 3D objects, so I learned about using Vertex and Pixel shaders to achieve desired effects such as the water.</p>
                        <p>The application was developed over Semester 1 and 2 for my 'Further Game and Graphical Systems Development' module in my second year at university. The first semester was entirely focussed on rendering and loading assets, and the second semester task was to implement physics to the scene we had created in semester 1.</p>

                    <h2>What I learned</h2>
                    <p>The development of this application introduced me to using a programmable pipeline for 3D rendering (had previously only used Fixed Function). It was my first experience using DirectX, which was useful as I had only used OpenGL previously. I learned to use HLSL for writing shaders, which also taught me about how lighting is applied to objects and how image effects such as fog are achieved. Lastly, this improved my C++ and general programming skills, and the original codebase was refactored throughout the development to keep the code clean and maintainable.</p>

The objective of the game is to complete three laps before your opponent does.</p>
                        <p>There were a few challenges developing the game, as it was my first time using MonoGame and the first time I had created a multiplayer application. The biggest challenge was making sure the correct client recieves the correct information for the game (such as current checkpoint), and that there is persistance between the two clients (such as who is red the car and who is the blue car).</p>

                    <p>The biggest challenge for this project was the character controller, and how to handle collisions. I went with a navigation mesh system for collisions, which also allowed me to set the players height when traversing the map. There is another (invisible) mesh of only the map floor, which covers the entire walkable area. Which allows me to check whether the player is above walkable ground (if not, it's considered a collision), and lets me set the height of the player as they walk up/down stairs, drop off of ledges, etc.</p>

To expand the game, I added side-scrolling, more enemies, a level editor, updated collision system, etc.</p>
                        <p>The biggest challenge while developing the game, was perfecting the collision system. It took a lot of testing and tweaking so the character wouldn't get stuck in the ground or go through any walls.</p>

                    <h2>What I learned</h2>
                    <p>This game taught me about using unfamiliar frameworks (SDL) and taught me about general game mechanics, such as collision detection, creating a character controller that feels good to use, and saving/loading data to a file. Creating the level editor allowed me to gain experience in tools development.</p>
                    <p>It also helped me improve my C++ and general programming skills.</p>

                        <p>This project is a simple wave-based dungeon game, the game has a 3D effect, but is rendered in a 2D framework called S2D (University's in-house framework). It was made for the my Fundamentals of Game and Graphical Systems Development module (Year 1, Semester 1), for the assignment we were tasked with creating a 2D game using the framework provided.</p>
                        <p>The 3D effect is achieved by layering multiple sprites per model, each sprite is a horizontal slice of the model, which is then positioned and rotated correctly to appear 3D.</p>

                    <p>The gameplay is an infinite wave-base game, where slimes spawn randomly, the objective is to survive as long as possible and reach the highest score, which is then uploaded to an online leaderboard to compare with others.</p>

                    <p>For the assignment, we were given freedom to create a 3D game using an engine of our choice. I decided to work by myself on this game, so I chose Unity, as I am most familiar with Unity over other similar engines such as UE4 or Godot. I was also required to keep a reflective journal throughout the development of the project, which can be seen <a href="https://spark.adobe.com/page/9uppQnKx0YJNk/">here</a>. The reflective journal documents each step of the game's development and all of the research I did for the game.</p>

                    <p>This was the first game I had worked on fully by myself (apart from game-jam games, and smaller projects), so I learned a lot about project management, time management, and various skills which go into making a game (such as creating the art and sound effects). I tried to push myself technically with the project, I had never looked into procedural generation before this, nor had I looked into pathfinding. Attempting both of these were big challenges for me, and feel as though attempting them taught me a lot.</p>

                        <p>Reclaim Earth is a pixelated sci-fi FPS, originally made for LOWREZJAM and expanded upon later. I worked with two other developers from the US on this project, which was my first experience working in a group. I did the programming and Game Design, Chase Bethea did all sound effects and Music for the game, James Brunner did the artwork and modelling for the game.</p>

                    <p>I gained valuable project management experience throughout the development of Reclaim Earth, I brought together all of the individual assets into the final project and implemented them with the mechanics. </p>
