            <p>Hi, my name is Anthony. I'm an aspiring games programmer, currently studying BSc Computer Games Programming at Staffordshire University. Most of my course work is developed using C++, for creating games, and game engines with frameworks such as OpenGL, DirectX and SDL. I also have previous experience using Unity and C# from using them for projects at college, and a small amount of web development experience (such as this portfolio!).</p>
