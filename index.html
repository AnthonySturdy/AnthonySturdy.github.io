                <h2><span>></span> about</h2>

                <p>Hi, my name is Anthony. I'm a student at <a href="https://www.staffs.ac.uk/">Staffordshire University</a> studying BSc Computer Games Programming, and currently a Sustained Engineer Intern at <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity Technologies</a> as part of the placement year on my course.</p>
                <p>My coursework primarly involves using C++ to create games and game engines with DirectX, OpenGL and SDL. Other modules have covered using C# for multithreaded/task-based applications and networked applications.</p>
                <p>At <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a>, I have worked on a variety of different projects and tasks. However, the majority of my time has been spent fixing engine bugs (C++), writing automated editor tests (C#) and improving various <a href="https://scan.coverity.com/">Coverity Static Analysis</a> tooling by creating a <a href="https://datastudio.google.com/overview">Google Data Studio</a> dashboard (Python, BigQuery) and implementing support for modelled functions, in order to reduce false positives (C++, C#).</p>

                        <p>Voxel-o-Defence is a tower-defence game, developed for the third semester of my 'Technical Games Production' module, where we were tasked with creating a game within 6 weeks in a group of 6.</p>
                        <p>I implemented mechanics related to the voxel terrain, a full list of features I implemented can be seen below. The voxel terrain system was originally prototyped in Unity while other team members set up DirectX11 boilerplate and camera controls, which allowed me to get the systems working before then porting from C# to C++ in the DirectX application.</p>

                    <h2>What I learned</h2>
                    <p>Working with 5 other people taught me a lot about working in a team and how important project management is. This was the biggest team I had worked with, and without constant communication, team meetings and updating our Trello board, we wouldn't have made nearly as much progress. We did encounter a few problems where people were waiting for other features to be finished before they could finish their own features, so in the future I think planning ahead and knowing which features to complete first in order to counter that would be useful.</p>
                    <p>With a larger team relying on my code, it also forced me to think about and plan the structure and readability of the code, which I hadn't had to before. This lead to me writing much more manageable and extensible code than I previously have in solo projects.</p>

                        <p>This project is a 3D Scene featuring a ship, water, land and rocks rendered using DirectX 11 and C++. This was my first experience using a programmable pipeline to render 3D objects, so I learned about using Vertex and Pixel shaders to achieve desired effects such as the water.</p>
                        <p>The application was developed over Semester 1 and 2 for my 'Further Game and Graphical Systems Development' module in my second year at university. The first semester was entirely focussed on rendering and loading assets, and the second semester task was to implement physics to the scene we had created in semester 1.</p>

                    <h2>What I learned</h2>
                    <p>The development of this application introduced me to using a programmable pipeline for 3D rendering (had previously only used Fixed Function). It was my first experience using DirectX, which was useful as I had only used OpenGL previously. I learned to use HLSL for writing shaders, which also taught me about how lighting is applied to objects and how image effects such as fog are achieved. Lastly, this improved my C++ and general programming skills, and the original codebase was refactored throughout the development to keep the code clean and maintainable.</p>
