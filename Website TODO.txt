New "Professional" website ideas
- Constant scrolling, all one page (Except maybe for portfolio pages?)
- Peel tab at top right for code version
- Top 'link' bar auto scrolls to each section
- Tabbed table for each portfolio category (Uni, college, personal, all)
- Abstract style (e.g. https://colorlib.com/wp/template/niko/, this but more muted colours?)
